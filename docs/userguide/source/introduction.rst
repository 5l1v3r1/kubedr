 Introduction

Kubernetes stores all the cluster data (such as resource specs) in
*etcd*. The *Kubedr* project implements data protection for this
data. In addition, certificates can be backed up as well but that is
optional. 

.. warning::

   The project is currently in Alpha phase. Features can still change
   and enhancements will be made to existing functionality. There may
   be many corner cases that may not work as expected.
