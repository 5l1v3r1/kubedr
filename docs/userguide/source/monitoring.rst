 Monitoring
============

*Kubedr* exposes several metrics that can be scraped with
`Prometheus`_ and visualised using `Grafana`_. Most of the metrics at
present deal with the internal implementation and hence, are not being
documented here. 

In the future, several metrics that are useful to the users will be
added. Some examples:

- Number of successful/failed backups
- Backup size
