## Requirements

- Since we need direct access to etcd, *Kubedr* currently works only
  for on-prem clusters or where ever etcd can be accessed. We are
  investigating how to extend the same functionality to clusters where
  etcd snapshot cannot be taken.

- The project is tested using 1.16 but we are currently verifying how
  many older versions can be supported.
