## Introduction

The *Kubedr* project is about protecting metadata of Kubernetes stored
in *etcd*. In addition, certificates can be backed up as well but that
is optional.

**The project is currently in Alpha phase. Changes can be made that
may not be backwards compatible. There may be many corner cases that
may not work.**
