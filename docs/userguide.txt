# Introduction

*TBD* Briefly explain what the project does. 

# Rationale

*TBD* Explain why this project exists and the advantages. 

# Installation

# # Requirements/Limitations

- Mention that for now, the product is on-prem only. 

- cert-manager

- Kubernetes version. Target 1.16 but ask Jessie to test all the way
  back to 1.12.

# # Steps to install

- In Alpha, it is probably ok to ask people to apply the manifest file
  directly from repo. *TODO* Check in full manifest file.

- Two images need to be made available.

  - controller manager

  - backup container

- For now, build images and push them to local registry. 

*TODO* Have a build script that internally calls "make" with right
IMG value.

- How to verify that install succeeded? Give kubectl command to list
  the resources in the kubedr-system namespace.

# Configuration

Before backups can be performed, a backup target location needs to be
registered. The project currently supports any S3 target as backup
target. If the destination bucket doesn't exist, it will automatically
be created. 

*TBD* Explain how to configure a BackupLocation and what happens when
one is configured?

# Backup

*TBD* Explain how to create MetadataBackupPolicy

# Restore

*TBD* Explain DR restore steps

# Monitoring and Metrics

*TBD* Explain about scraping metrics with Prometheus and visualising
with Grafana. 

# Troubleshooting

- How to check logs?

- How to collect logs? What information needs to be sent for debugging?
